# GamesPortfolio
## Introduction
This is a portfolio/personal collection for various mini games I have created for gifts, experience, and for fun. The technologies used are primarily p5.js and JavaScript.

## Next Steps
1. Create leaderboards for Plane and Bounce using Browerify and Node.js (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-program-to-write-data-in-a-text-file/)
2. Fix minor bugs in close to border incidents in Plane
3. Fix major bugs in Snake and deploy
