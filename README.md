# SproutMonkeyGames
## Introduction
This is a portfolio/personal collection for various mini games I have created for gifts, experience, and for fun. The technologies used are primarily p5.js and JavaScript.
## Catalogue
1. Plane

*Dodge obstacles using WASD or arrow keys.*
2. Bounce

Bounce a ball against baskets in this brick-breaker esque game.
3. Pong

Play pong with WASD vs arrow keys.
4. Snake (in progress)

Collect bananas while avoiding walls and your growing army.
## Next Steps
1. Create leaderboards for Plane and Bounce using Browerify and Node.js (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-program-to-write-data-in-a-text-file/)
2. Fix minor bugs in close to border incidents in Plane
3. Fix major bugs in Snake and deploy
